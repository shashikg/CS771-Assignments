\noindent
\textbf{Programming Part 1: }\\
On increasing $k$ there is improvement in the reconstruction of images! Morevover the images appear to be more clearer.
Explanation is simple higher the value of $k$ more the no of features retained in $z$.\\
Please find the plots from next page.

\noindent
\textbf{Programming Part 2: }\\
Visually tSNE appears to be better, clusters are more seperated as well as on running 10 different initiallisations errors in tSNE seems to be less than that of PCA! \\
Please find the plots from next page.
